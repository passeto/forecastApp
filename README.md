<!-- Get Started / Install: -->

## Getting started

Prerequisites: To run the react-native project on your mobile or emulator you need some
more specific settings, I recommend this link
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) if you do not already have the recommended settings on your machine.

1. Install
   [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) e
   [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/),
   in case you don't have them yet.

2. Clone repository:

   sh
   \$ git clone git://github.com/passeto/forecastApp.git

3) Go to project folder:

   sh
   \$ cd forecastApp

4. Install all dependences:

   sh
   \$ npm install ou yarn

5) Finally run:

   sh
   $ react-native run-android (Android) or npx react-native run-android
   ou
   $ react-native run-ios (IOS) or npx react-native run-ios

Now you will see the app running on your mobile phone or emulator.
remember to enable the location of your smartphone :D
